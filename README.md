### Elias Nybondas

I am a diligent 22-year-old engineering student with a keen interest in the expansive domain of IT. My journey so far has equipped me with a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and C++. My expertise lies not only with the aforementioned languages, but also in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Node.js.

I'm always open to discussions and collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me directly!
